						<h2>About Me</h2>	
							<p>I started making short films when I was in my 3rd year of engineering (year-2008), its then when I made my 1st 
							short film "Strangers", but with very limited budget and technical knowledge it did not turn out what I expected 
							but I was happy and excited with the entire process, it gave me a different feeling altogether, so I decided to 
							continue making more and learning more. I made some short films after that, some were incomplete, some completed 
							but left me with an incomplete feeling, every time while I was on the editing table, I felt the need of something 
							more. I had no training neither any prior experience in film making so each short film I made whether I was able to 
							complete it or leave it midway taught me something. Slowly I started realizing that film making was no longer just a 
							hobby for me, it was becoming my passion. In 2012, I made a short film titled "Payback", it was selected in Delhi 
							International Film Festival. In 2015 I worked on another Bengali short film "Amawron" which got selected in Kolkata 
							film festival. However, after making every short film when I see it, I feel I could have done it better, maybe this 
							feeling of mine keeps me driving for more. For me, film making is a journey and I am happy that I started it.</p>
